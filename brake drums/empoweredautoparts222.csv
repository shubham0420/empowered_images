Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat.
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal.
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance.
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion.",,"Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat.
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal.
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance.
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion.",,"Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat.
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal.
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance.
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion.",,"Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less.
When the brake is applied, the brake shoe presses the lining against the inside of the brake drum. The friction between lining and drum provides the braking effect. 
Drum brakes are designed to use friction to convert kinetic energy into heat energy. This heat should be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. 
Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal. 
This effect is worsened by poor maintenance. If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. 
Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. ","Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. 
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal. 
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance. 
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. ",,"Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less.
When the brake is applied, the brake shoe presses the lining against the inside of the brake drum. The friction between lining and drum provides the braking effect. 
Drum brakes are designed to use friction to convert kinetic energy into heat energy. This heat should be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. 
Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal. 
This effect is worsened by poor maintenance. If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. 
Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. ","Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. 
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal. 
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance. 
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. 
Once that rate has been reached, applying greater pedal pressure will not result in a change of this rate, and indeed the effects mentioned can substantially reduse it. Ultimately this is what brake fade is, regardless of the mechanism of its causes. When replacing brake drums, care should be taken in relacing the brake fluid and brake shoes, in all instances.

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat.
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal.
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance.
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion.","Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less.
When the brake is applied, the brake shoe presses the lining against the inside of the brake drum. The friction between lining and drum provides the braking effect. 
Drum brakes are designed to use friction to convert kinetic energy into heat energy. This heat should be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. 
Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal. 
This effect is worsened by poor maintenance. If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. 
Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. ","Brand : RDA

Rear Fitment","Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. 
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal. 
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance. 
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. ","Brand : RDA

Drum brakes are still used in some modern cars and most smaller cars, because of some engineering and cost advantages. They are often applied to the rear wheels since most of the stopping force is generated by the front brakes of the vehicle and therefore the heat generated in the rear is significantly less. Drum brakes, like most other types,are designed to convert kinetic energy into heat energy via the process of friction. This heat is intended to be further transferred to atmosphere, but can just as easily transfer into other components of the braking system. Brake drums have to be large to cope with the massive forces that are involved, and they must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat.
Excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking. Excessive heating of the brake drums can cause the brake fluid to vaporise, which reduces the hydraulic pressure being applied to the brake shoes. Therefore less retardation is achieved for a given amount of pressure on the pedal.
The effect is worsened by poor maintenance.
If the brake fluid is old and has absorbed moisture it thus has a lower boiling point and brake fade occurs sooner. Brake fade is not always due to the effects of overheating. If water gets between the friction surfaces and the drum, it acts as a lubricant and reduces braking efficiency. The water tends to stay there until it is heated sufficiently to vaporise, at which point braking efficiency is fully restored. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion.",,"Brand : RDA
